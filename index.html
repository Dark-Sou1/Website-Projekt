                Have you ever wondered-"How do you exist?" or what would have happened if you did not have a brain...
                As you will venture into this article, you will understand that our brain has a number of facts that you are unaware of.
                This article is divided into four different sections for the convinience of the readers. Enjoy your time reading.

                    <h2>What is the brain?</h2>
                    The brain is a complex organ that controls thought, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, 
                    temperature, hunger and every process that regulates our body. Together, the brain and spinal cord that extends from it make up the central nervous system, or CNS.<br>
                    <br>
                    The complexity of the connectivity between these cells is mind-boggling. Each neuron can make contact with thousands or even tens of thousands of others, via tiny structures called synapses. Our brains form a million new connections for every second of our lives. The pattern and strength of the connections is constantly changing and no two brains are alike.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is in these changing connections that memories are stored, habits learned and personalities shaped, by reinforcing certain patterns of brain activity, and losing others.
                    <h2>What is the brain made of?</h2>
                    Like other parts of your body, your brain is made up of cells. Many of these cells help regulate the chemistry of the brain and give it structure. But some are specialized to do far more. These cells, known as neurons, do most of the work that allows you to think, feel, and move<br>
                    <br>
                    Weighing about 3 pounds in the average adult, the brain is about 60% fat. The remaining 40% is a combination of water, protein, carbohydrates and salts. The brain itself is a not a muscle. 
                    It contains blood vessels and nerves, including neurons and glial cells.
                    <h2>How does the brain work?</h2>
                    The brain sends and receives chemical and electrical signals throughout the body. Different signals control different processes, and your brain interprets each. Some make you feel tired, for example, while others make you feel pain.<br>
                    <br>
                    Some messages are kept within the brain, while others are relayed through the spine and across the bodyâ€™s vast network of nerves to distant extremities. To do this, the central nervous system relies on billions of neurons (nerve cells).<br>
                    <br>
                    A human brain may contain as many as 100 billion neurons of different kinds. The neurons connect through long, spidery arms and communicate with each other through electrochemical signals. Each of the brain's 100 billion neurons can connect to at least 1,000 other neurons, 
                    so a brain may have at least 100 trillion connections in all. Every second, a single neuron may send as many as 1,000 signals. These signals can zip from neuron to neuron at speeds up to 250 miles (400 kilometers) an hour.<br>
