                The brain is a fascinating collection of neurons in the form of a net that transmits signals and processes them which causes us to act or react vigorously.<br>

                        Connection to the body
                    </h3>

                        Our brain is the central system for our entire being and existence. It is the sole reason why we react to stimuli, why we can understand and feel, sympathize, or even move. But, it is not the only thing in our body responsible for all this. If it weren’t for the various nerves and muscles in our body it would have been impossible for the brain to provide an output. 
                        The brain is a sophisticated system just like an interpreter like an IDE - if there was no way for the system to analyze data and then transfer it to give an output, our existence would have been indefinitely stalled as we would have been incapable of understanding anything. Thus if we are alive and active it is mostly because of the complex design of our brain, nerves, and muscles.<br>

                        What is the brain made of?
                    </h3>
                        The brain is a mass of cells, so complex in design that we become capable of even doing the unthinkable. Its mass comes mostly from water and fats which is over 60% of its entire mass. In fact, due to extensive thinking, it manages to consume about 25% of the body’s energy despite being so insignificantly small in size.
                        It is made up of a trillion of specialized cells and neurons and comprehends the information for us. The specialized cells are called neurons which transfer the signals.<br>

                        1. Cerebellum
                    </h3>
                    The cerebellum is important for making postural adjustments to maintain balance. Its input from vestibular receptors and proprioceptors modulates commands to motor neurons to compensate for shifts in body position or changes in load upon muscles.
                    <h3>
                        2. Cerebrum
                    </h3>
                    The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum initiates and coordinates movement and regulates temperature. Other areas of the cerebrum enable speech, judgment, thinking and reasoning, problem-solving, emotions, and learning. Other functions are related to vision, hearing, touch, and other senses.
                    <h3>
                        3. Medulla
                    </h3>
                    Your medulla oblongata is located at the base of your brain, where the brain stem connects the brain to your spinal cord. It plays an essential role in passing messages between your spinal cord and brain. It's also essential for regulating your cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
                    <h3>
                        4. Spinal Cord
                    </h3>
                    The spinal cord functions primarily in transmitting nerve signals from the motor cortex to the body and the afferent fibers of the sensory neurons to the sensory cortex. It is also a center for coordinating many reflexes and contains reflex arcs that can independently control reflexes.

                The brain due to the intensity in its design has the ability to perform, an interestingly large number of activities which also enables us to react vigorously to stimuli provided to our body via heat, touch, syringes, thorns, velvet and ice...
